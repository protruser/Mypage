## index Page

<p>It is a page that you can see as soon as you access the web page. The basic configuration consisted of header, body, and footer, and a navigation bar was added to the header. And the content composition was divided into self-introduction, education, and experience.</p>

## GitHub Stats

<p>On thhe GitHub Stats page, There are some information about my GitHub account such as identities and repositories. Imported GitHub's API first, created a tag in JavaScript, and applied it to the GitHub Stats page. In the account information part, css was applied in the same way as the Index page, and in the Repositories part, the same css was newly applied one by one in card format.</p>

#### Category Sort
<p>When adding the project list to the Project page, the page became very long. Therefore, needed the function to classify the projects according to their categories. User can sort the project list by clicking the button that appears at the bottom of the "Projects" text.</p>

## Attachment

<p>Each device even has a function that provides a different UI, so you can freely visit the page.
<br>
  <br>
As the page is not perfect, if there is anything I need to modify the UI or if there is anything I need to add, I would appreciate it if you could give me PR.</p>
