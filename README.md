## index Page

<p>It is a page that you can see as soon as you access the web page. The basic configuration consisted of header, body, and footer, and a navigation bar was added to the header. And the content composition was divided into self-introduction, education, and experience.</p>

## Contact

<p>On the Contact page, a simple profile was created and an input function to send mail was put in. (However, as of March 24, the mail sending function has not been implemented yet.)</p>

## Attachment

<p>Each device even has a function that provides a different UI, so you can freely visit the page.
<br>
  <br>
As the page is not perfect, if there is anything I need to modify the UI or if there is anything I need to add, I would appreciate it if you could give me PR.</p>
