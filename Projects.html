                        Our team devised a system for recommending a recipe after natural language processing. Image
                        analysis was performed on ham, cheese, bread, eggs, and onions, and the results were as follows

                        basic UI creation and implementation. The basic UI was composed through Figma and visualized
                        with a UML diagram. In the implementation stage, the basic structure of the drawing editor, such
                        as color, move, cut, undo, and redo was implemented with manual.

                        stages: Step 2: Investigating, conceiving multiple open sources and implementing. Using the
                        OpenCV library, the bill was implemented to determine the real or fake according to the
                        similarity when it was brought to the screen. In addition, several functions were added to the
                        GitHub page to activate the function as a kind of community.
